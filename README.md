# The BroadStreet Institute

## Introduction
[BroadStreet](http://www.broadstreet.io) is a data and software company for social good. We believe that all people deserve access to the best information possible. BroadStreet builds our software for those working towards community change. We strive to ensure that data is accessible, affordable, and delightful to explore. BroadStreet has thousands of members all over the country. Members include students, non-profit leaders, and executives of multi-state and national organizations. We are proud of the range of our members.
Here at BroadStreet we believe that ‘Good Data Heals the World’ and given the ever-changing policy landscape surrounding maternal health, we believe it prudent to capture and create a repository of maternal health data for future populations. 
In the anticipated policy changes that occurred at the federal level in June, 2022, an initiative started to quickly save any data regarding Induced Terminations of Pregnancy (ITOP) before any data could potentially be lost due to removal from public access. As time progressed, the Maternal Health Track was created. As a track, we are trying to create a data repository of ITOP data at the county- and demographic- levels, and building out a dataset that allows a cohesive and standardized reporting mechanism for all states and counties that have publicly available data dashboards.

## Structure of the Dataset
### <u>Definition:</u>
Each state varies in how they define abortion and ITOP.
|State | Definitions of Abortion / ITOP | Definition Source| 
|------------- | ------------- | -------------|
<strong>Alabama</strong>  | "Abortion" means the use or prescription of any instrument, medicine, drug, or any other substance or device with the intent to terminate the pregnancy of a woman known to be pregnant with knowledge that the termination by those means will with reasonable likelihood cause the death of the unborn child. Such use or prescription is not an abortion if done with the intent to save the life or preserve the health of an unborn child, remove a dead unborn child, or to deliver an unborn child prematurely in order to preserve the health of both the mother (pregnant woman) and her unborn child. The term, abortion, as used in these rules, does not include a procedure or act to terminate the pregnancy of a woman with an ectopic pregnancy, nor does it include the procedure or act to terminate the pregnancy of a woman when the fetus has a lethal anomaly. For purposes of these rules, a lethal fetal anomaly means that the child would die at birth or be still born. For the purpose of this definition, ectopic pregnancy means any pregnancy resulting from a fertilized egg that has implanted or attached outside the uterus. The term also includes a pregnancy resulting from a fertilized egg implanted inside the cornu of the uterus.  | Rules of the Alabama State Department of Public Health <br> (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NaUQZT1JCOZ8a434C1QLiV2VbMcJNit6/view) <br>  |

## Data Entry/Data Quality 
Each day, volunteer interns on the Maternal Health Team will help us browse and document Induced Terminations of Pregnancy (ITOP) cases at the county level and by the categorical breakdowns listed in the Data Inventory. Interns will be on the weekly rotation schedule to switch from data entry and data quality task to ensure all data are entered accurately and timely. During data entry week, interns will be browsing through primary source and transfer/document those number into the state spreadsheet. During data quality week, interns will confirming of completion of the spreadsheet, determine the accuracy of the data entered, and fix any errors that they have find.

## Methodology
### <u>Challenges:</u>
As seen in the  list above, states are unique in both how they report their data and what data they report. 
### <u>UNREPORTED DATA (OR NOT REPORTED):</u>
‘NA’ indicates that the data is not available. ‘NR’ indicates that the data are not reported  by the state dashboard. 
### <u>SUPPRESSED DATA:</u>
‘SUPPRESSED’ indicates that the data for the county is suppressed due to patient confidentiality concerns, or ‘due to the number being below a certain amount’ (generally counts less than 20). Note: county totals are not displayed for confidentiality reasons but they are still part of the overall state count. 
### <u>ENTERING ZERO:</u>
In order to ensure accurate reporting of data, we avoided using zeros in our datasets unless it was explicitly stated and/or present within the original source. If we didn’t see a zero, or a note about suppressing counts due to low numbers, we assumed the data was not reported and inputted an ‘NR’ value.”
